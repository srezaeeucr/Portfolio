# Linear Regression on USA Housing Prices  

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow using the **USA Housing dataset** (available on Kaggle). It is a classic beginner dataset and a great way to practice regression modeling, exploratory data analysis, and performance evaluation.  

## Project Overview  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Feature selection and scaling  
- Linear Regression for price prediction  
- Model evaluation with metrics:  
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
  - RÂ² Score  

## How to Run  
1. Clone this repository  
2. Download the **USA_Housing.csv** dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project directory  
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook step by step  

## Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn  

## Notes  
This is a baseline model. Performance can be improved with advanced feature engineering, regularization methods (Ridge/Lasso), or more complex algorithms like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting.
