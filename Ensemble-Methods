# Pharmaceutical Drug Efficacy Modeling

**Objective:** Predict and analyze the efficacy of a drug across patient populations using clinical and biomarker data.

> **Note:** The dataset used in this project is **simulated** for demonstration purposes.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Explore distributions of patient features and efficacy
- Correlation analysis between clinical and biomarker variables
- Visualization of efficacy across doses, age groups, and disease severity

## Modeling Drug Efficacy (Regression and Classification)
- Regression: Predict continuous drug efficacy using Random Forest Regressor
- Classification: Predict responder vs non-responder using Random Forest Classifier
- Feature encoding and scaling applied to clinical and biomarker data

## Model Evaluation
- Regression metrics: RMSE, RÂ²
- Classification metrics: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix
- Feature importance analysis for interpretability

## Advanced Analysis and Visualization
- Dose-response simulations using PK/PD-style models
- Longitudinal modeling with repeated measures
- Subgroup analysis by age, disease severity, and biomarkers
- Monte Carlo simulations to quantify uncertainty
- Interactive visualizations using Plotly for exploration
