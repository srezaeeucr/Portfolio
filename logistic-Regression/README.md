# Logistic Regression on Titanic Survival Prediction

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow using the **Titanic dataset** (available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)). It is a classic beginner dataset and a great way to learn about data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Handling missing values with imputation
- Feature engineering and categorical encoding
- Logistic Regression for binary classification
- Model evaluation with multiple metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - ROC Curve & AUC

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the Titanic dataset (`train.csv`) from Kaggle and place it in the project directory.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook step by step.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn  

## Notes

This is a baseline model. Further improvements can be made through advanced feature engineering and experimenting with other algorithms like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting.
